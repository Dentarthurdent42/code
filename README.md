# code
WHAT: This script(?) is intended to produce random results while eliminating the possibility of selecting the same element twice
HOW: It should take an iterable and assign weights to each element based on how recently it was selected
WHY: I was sick of mediocre gacha mechanics in games like Vampire Survivors (excluding VS itself) that would give me the same thing after rerolling, so I thought I'd make my own
